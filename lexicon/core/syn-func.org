** DEFINITION

transitive verb preceding its pronominal object, this whole phrase modifying a main nominal

*** 
One wonders if one should not create one larger category vt+N.adN.

* =SYNTACTIC FUNCTION= vttoN:+.vt+Nab{S}
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: uuid-24d808d0-b208-4e51-a61d-cfeb1149d5a8
:END:        


** DEFINITION

ditransitive verb followed by its indirect object that whole construction being followed by a transitive verb with its abstract nominal object.

*** 
This is certainly an odd category to introduce. The nominalisation of the S being unmarked. Still, the category may serve as a reminder for a construction that needs a proper analysis.

:END:        


** DEFINITION

ditransitive (causative) verb followed by pivotal object N1 (who is caused to vtt) the object N2

*** 
This is an extraordinary syntactic frame, and time must show whether it is unique. The special syntactic case arises from the fact that the causativeness in the verb leads to a special assignment of roles to the two object nouns. I suppose one might also impose a meaning like "impose on N1's shoulders the object N2, in which case we should simply have a plain vtt+N1.+N2.

*** 
One might obviously have classified this as a straighforward vadN, but it seems worth looking out for adjectives that modify action nominalisations.

** DEFINITION

complex nominal; construction type: nominal followed by a suffix "npostadN" which comes out as "-N2" in this formula

[THE BRACKET NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIELD "CONSTRUCTION TYPE"]

*** 
Nominal suffixation in classical Chinese is relatively rare, the only productive suffix being 子 . And in a case like 豎子 the problem whether 子 is or is not a suffix remains undecidable. Both views can be supported by arguments, and very importantly: the question which of these analyses is correct is alien to Chinese commentatorial thinking.

:END:        


** DEFINITION

non-referential pronoun modifying an omitted nominal head of the construction.

*** 
This is a so-called "exocentric" use of an impersonal pronoun.

The "0" after pronouns refers to non-referential pronouns in the sense that the pronouns in questions do not invite one to identify any item, set, or person.

a verb (or: deverbal particle) preceding and modifying a sentence, that whole phrase being in construction with a preceding sentence

*** 
See the category padS1.postS2 which is closely related to this one. Deverbals do emerge in our system as "v", their grammaticalisation is indicated by their syntactic embedding, these "v" being either "ad" or "post" something else.

** DEFINITION

ditranstive verb with a nominal object, this construction preceding and in construction with a verbal expression

*** 
This category assembles structurally similar verbs all of which are similarly hard to analyse. The question how exactly an analysis of pivotal constructions should proceed remains highly sensitive and deserves much more discussion. 

However, the words that will need to be discussed in this connection are assembled in this category. There are many instances where the role of TLS can only be to identify examples relevant to problem areas for analysis and examples of probematic "isopmorphic" phenomena, rather than solving the problems raised by these phenomena. The identification of structurally similar sets is in itself only a first step. But it is a necessary step. Close analysis will probably show that much of what is called pivotal here is not really pivotal.

** DEFINITION

deverbal word preceding and modifying a verbal expression, traditionally: a deverbal adverb in preverbal position

*** 
The distinction between the categories vadV, nadV, and padV is problematic whenever it is unclear from which function it is most natural to derive the adverbial use in question.

The distinction with the presentential vadS must remain uncertain whenever it is unclear whether what follows is simply a verbal expression or must be taken as a verbal sentence with an implicit understood subject.

** DEFINITION

transitive noun, i.e. a noun which is semantically transitive on the one hand, and for which the semantic object is expressed explicitly

*** 
The notion that not only abstract nouns but also concrete nouns can be transitive is current from many studies in the valency of words. MEL'CUK 1984-1999 presents in commendable detail many relevant cases in what he calles the "regime" of a noun. The notion of a ruler is transitive because a ruler is only a ruler to the extent that he is a ruler of a realm. A protector is only a protector to the extent that there is something which he protects. A murderer is only a murderer to the extent that there is someone he has killed. All agent nominalisations of transitive verbs retain the transitivity of the verb from which they derive in this abstract sense. Even the notion of a "wife" differs from that of a woman that the former is relational and technically speaking transitive whereas the latter is not. Thus the class of transitive nouns that are modified by other nouns that precede them in this specific "transitive" way is considerable. A large number of what are now still simply nouns in TLS will have to be reclassified as ntpost-N.

*** 
One might be tempted to take the S to be a case of unmarked sentence nominalisation. Many cases of this phenomenon need to be compared before one can make an informed decision on this possibility. And even if one decides that this is ultimately how one wishes to take these cases, it will be interesting to have such cases as a significant sub-category of vt+N.adV.

** DEFINITION

composite nominal



complex nominal expression

*** 
Our concept of NP differs, for systematic theoretical reasons, from that current in general linguistics because the concept of a word as distinct from an idiomatic syntactic collocation is not well-defined for classical Chinese.

The question of the wordhood of a given NP does not arise until a testable criterion or definition of the notion of the word for classical Chinese is forthcoming. It is not clear that the notion of a word, as it is currently employed for many languages, usefully applies to an ancient language like classical Chinese where intonational features of wordhood cannot normally be tested.

There are binomes like 葡萄 and 蝴蝶 which are bisyllabic but not semantically compound because their parts have no independent meaning. These belong to the category nn "semantically unanalysable binome", in analogy with the much commoner category series of vv "unanalysable verbal binomes". And any definition of the notion of a word for classical Chinese would have to classify these as words rather than as syntactic compounds, one would have thought.

Reduplicated "NPs" are listed under n.red

They are simply convenient labels to make distinct syntactic phenomena systematically retrievable.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:        


** DEFINITION

an intransitive verb without an explicit or implicit and contextually determinate subject of any kind, definite or indefinite (e.g. yu3 雨 "it is raining")

*** 
Since the judgment that something is vi0 depends on an assessment whether a non-overt subject is or is not to be taken as "understood", there is an uncomfortable subjectivity in the judgment whether something is a subjectless word or not. For practical reasons, it is important to register all plausibe or even possible cases of subjectlessness in order to be prepared for a systematic investigation of the proper boundaries of the phenomenon.

Note that the common absence of an overt subject does not necessarily argue for the subjectlessness of verb. In the case ke3 可 "this is acceptable" the presence of pronominal subject is rare, and ***shi4 ke3 ye3 是可也 "such a thing is acceptable"*** is not a sentence we expect to find very commonly. Nonetheless, there is no sense in which ke3 可 places a feature "acceptability" in some location. On the contrary, it attaches this predicate to a subject. Thus the syntactic diagnose that something is an ordinary vi and not a v0 is in fact partly based on logical and semantic considerations - some might wish to stress "it is based on logical and semantic Western prejudice".

** DEFINITION

ditransitive verb followed by its direct object, and this followed by an indirect nominal object

*** 
1. We need to separate out the cases where the indirect object comes last and subsume them under vtt+N1.oN2, in accordance with our principles on the distinction between "o" and "+".

2. Double object constructions are often notoriously difficult to distinguish reliably from single object constructions with a nominal complement. Time complements are obviously not construed as indirect objects, but place nouns can raise problems with movement verbs.

** DEFINITION

a combination of more than one particle

*** 
This is a lame and tame preliminary collection of forms. A great deal of work needs to be done on complex particles. In general, grammatical particles are the last elements that are to be entered into the system. The idea is to start out from non-empty words, rather than empty words. Good dictionaries of complex particles exist. However, none of these concentrate on structural analysis.

** DEFINITION

verbal, which is a contraction of a transitive verb which follows a transitive verbal as its object

*** 
This category is in a sense "unnatural": in it we record the occurrence of pronouns in object position. And we do this simply in order to chart the different behaviour of different pronouns in this respect. In principle, one could mark all nouns that occur in object versus subject positions, but in general nouns are indifferent to these two functions.

*** 
Whether the N here really should be taken as a PIVOT is controversial, and in the end probably wrong. But by taking it in this way, we are able to subclassify the constructions possible in a convenient way.

** DEFINITION

subjectless transitive verb with a verbal object of which the subject is lexically predictable and omitted (e.g. bi4 必 "it is imperative to V)

*** 
The subjectlessness of these vt can be controversial. For example if a generic subject like "one" is always unexpressed, or expressed by zero, does this count as an example of subjectlessness? If it does, why do we not count as subjectless the many cases where ordinary verbs have generic subjects of this sort? I am not sure that one will be able to sort this out very satisfactorily.

** DEFINITION

a verb which precedes and modifies a transitive verb with its object

*** 
These words have this in common that they modify the verb phrase they precede by quantifying into the object. In principle, we have a grammatical relation between non-contiguous elements here.

Many of the words in this category are specialised on object quantification, others - like 皆 - are only occasionally found in this function and normally quantify the subject.

** DEFINITION

transitive complex verbal expression with a lexically determined or predictable omitted object.

*** 
For example in the English "he drinks" we have a verb of which the object is understood lexically to be "alcohol". In "he is eating" the object that is lexically understood is "some kind of food". We must try identify the Chinese VPs that work like this and try to distinguish them carefully from intransitive verbs.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb phrase with contextually determinate obligatorily omitted subject

*** 
This category raises a host of problems. The subject who does the comparing can definitely never be explicit. 諸 stands for something like 之於 and would appear to make this into a VPt0+prep+N, although one suspects a more appropriate way of analysing the idiom could be to take 譬 as vtt0+N1.+prep+N2 and to refuse to treat this as a compound at all. But for lexicographic purposes we do want to record this compound as an important idiom one has to learn.

This category allows one in special cases to assemble the uses as a grammatical subject of certain nouns. In the cases like that of 民 this is of considerable historical interest. But in the case of most nouns there is no need to list and study their uses as objects versus subjects. Syntactic categories like these illustrate very well the way in which our analytical categories quite often do reflect our more general cognitive interest in addition to our grammatical interest. Our categories are analytic tools which we create for our varied intellectual uses.

** DEFINITION

mass noun, a noun that does not refer to countable concrete items and is not plausibly considered as abstract

*** 
1. cannot be counted by concrete individual items ( 三民 cannot mean "three peoples")

2. can be counted by amount-of-stuff classifiers

3. when immediately preceded and modified by a number, mass nouns are counted by kinds ( 三酒 "three kinds of wine")

4. when immediately preceded and modified by a demonstrative pronoun, the reference is typically to a kind of nm, not to a certain concrete amount of it

It is crucial to remember that one and the same word can be used both as a mass noun and as a count noun, an obvious example of this being 毛 1. nm hair; 2. nc a hair

** DEFINITION

binome particle preceding and modifying a verbal expression

*** 
The repertoire of construction types of this category is particularly resistant to systematic analysis. The reason for this is that syntactic relations between particles are sui generis and cannot be carried over from those relations that obtain between nominals and verbals. As a result, the specification of construction types will contain many cases of unspecified concatenation "+".

** DEFINITION

ditransitive verb (i.e. verb with two objects) with the second, the indirect object N2 introduced with a preposition (i.e. a postposed transitive coverb)

*** 
This category must be carefully distinguished from that of vt followed by a localising prepositional phrase. At times, this distinction can be troublesome, but in general it seems worth trying to make it. The question is whether the link with the prepositional phrase is to be regarded as lexicalised, and such decisions on lexicalisation are bound to be subjective at times.

A particle like ér 而 is taken to be more closely linked with what follows it than with the verb that precedes. The arguments for this way of reading such phrases will need discussion.

One notes that when 而 comes between verbal expressions, it often remains possible to construe these verbal expressions as "minor sentences" with omitted subjects, and there is litte to prove that we should not analyse these cases as padS1.postS2.

** DEFINITION

Reduplicated intransitive verb.

*** 
These are normally intensitive, reiterative or continuative, semantically, and they need to be systematically subclassified under these semantic categories, and possibly there are more relevant sematnic categories. 

There are many reduplicative intransitive verbs which are never used without reduplication. These belong, conceptually, into the syntactic category "vvi.red". Thus all reduplicative intransitive verbs need to be tested to see whether they really belong into a category to be established, the vvi.red. 

WANG WEIMAO 1999 has an exhaustive survey of reduplicative binomes in classical Chinese and will, I suppose, remain the classical reference for a long time to come. The system of the range of semantic functions of reduplication remains to be explored.

This is a peculiar case where the preposition reconstructed in 焉 does not seem to have any candidate for a subject. This is unusual. We only note it in passing without attributing any particular importance to it. The question, however, whether 焉 should be designated as verbal is amusing: the word does have a referential object, here as in many other cases, and one would have thought that this is a sufficient condition for assigning the category "v". I have hesitated a long time over this case.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb with a verbal object (the subject of both verbs being lexically determinate as being the same as that of the main verb)

*** 
1. The distinction between a verbal and a sentential (minor sentence) object is sometimes difficult to make.

2. One probably needs to divide this class into those cases where the two verbs have the same subject and those where they do not. But it seems to me that this is properly done in the semantic category assigned, the default category being the one where the subject is the same for both verbs.

3. Whether what follows a vt+V is to be taken as a V or as an action-nominalisation (nab - act) can be a puzzling question. For example, in 輕死 "make light of death" it is not very clear exactly how one would argue that 死 should be declared verbal or action-nominalised. There is also always the profoundly puzzling problem whether a subject of 死 is understood or not.

4. It is important to realise that it always remains relevant to ask what the subject is of the verbal object. One only understands the verbal object V when one recognises its logical subject to be the same as that of the main verb. However, this subject cannot be explicit. Contrast the common syntactic category vt(+N[PIVOT].)+V which exhibits the same surface structure but has quite different semantics.

There is no subject for 為 whereas the subject is merely omitted and understood in the case of 悅 .

This is another case where the category V in the object really refers to a minor SENTENCE. Thus perhaps this category should be reclassified as vt0+S1.adS2. One might even consider the possibility of taking the V to be really an unmarked nominalisation. Thus this category deserves further study.

In a traditionalist manner these words are taken as pronouns. The objective syntactic criteria for their being pronouns in this context remain unclear.

** DEFINITION

transitive abstract noun, i.e. an abstract, typically deverbal, noun the concept of which involves an action directed at an object

*** 
Action nouns are often semantically as transitive as the verbs they derive from. The transitive verb "to murder Caesar" seems exactly as transitive as the corresponding noun "the murder of Caesar". (For "Caesar's murderer" see the category of transitive agent nouns "nt - ag".

Note that "murder" can be considered as such, without any focus on who gets murdered. But even in that case, murder remains something that is construed as murder of someone.

This is a preliminary collection of some nouns that would need to be considered in connection with transitivity of abstract nouns. One is tempted to subsume them under the straightforward nab category, but it seems useful to keep them separate for a while as a point of departure for a proper study of the phenomeon of transitivity in nouns.

** DEFINITION

complex abstract noun

*** 
Criteria one can try to use to determine whether a given noun is abstract:

1. cannot be counted with classifiers and are counted - if at all - not by physical items (see nab.c "counted abstract nouns")

2. cannot be quantified by universal, existential or graded quantifiers 

3. cannot be specified with respect to amounts of any concrete stuff

4. the object designated by the n cannot be said to move in space

Criteria for some basic related subclassifications of nouns

Nouns that can be counted and quantified by items or concrete things are called count nouns nc.

Nouns that cannot be counted or quantified by concrete items but can be quantified by amounts or kinds rather than items are regarded as mass nouns and these are called nm. When nm are preceded by a demonstrative pronoun, the interpretation is "this kind of nm".



The identification and the semantic subclassification of abstract nouns poses insurmountable problems because abstraction clearly is a matter of degrees on the one hand, and abstraction is a heterogeneous phenomenon. The vague and necessarily overlapping semantic subcategories introduced so far are no more than a first aid towards a resolution of these severe and unresolved analytical problems. Perhaps one should have opted for no subcategorisation at all, but we have decided to make a preliminary attempt to sort the material into major groups, even at the risk of having to make many arbitrary decisions in this process of preliminary sorting. It is obvious that this general category requires detailed subclassification.

** DEFINITION

ditransitive verb with a nominal object, this phrase preceding and being modified by a (co)verb with its nominalised sentence object

*** 
The ditransitive verb has only one object and the second object is introduced by a coverbal phrase. It is not a trivial task to bring this semantico-syntactic fact out elegantly in our categorial system, but it remains an important observation that coverbal expressions before or after a verb may on the one side specify an object of that verb, and may on the other hand have completely independent functions that have nothing to do with the valency of the verb.

** DEFINITION

ditransitive verb with its nominal object, preceded and modified by (co)verbal transitive verb with its object N2 (which typically is the indirect object of the vtt)

*** 
Technically, I suppose, one might declare these to be syntactically "vt" and not "vtt", although semantically they often clearly are the latter. It seems semantically wrong to disregard the ditransitive nature of the logical predicate involved. The point deserves further systematic discussion.

** DEFINITION

pronoun preceding and in construction with a predicate, with an omitted topic understood as preceding the whole construction

*** 
There is a pervasive problem whether one is entitled to assume a very general omitted topic when a sentence begins with one of these pronouns. It would have to be clear from the context which word is to be supplied for such "deletion" or omission to become a plausible hyptothesis. An interesting contrast is with the constructions beginning with subjectless 無 "there were none who".

** DEFINITION

count noun, noun that can be counted by individual items and are actually found counted.

*** 
One might have left all these words as simply n.

As it stands this group is just a preliminary and partial list of nouns that are actually counted. This category should perhaps be subdivided into ncpost-v(NU), ncpost-ncl etc. in order to enable one to study the culture and natural history of counting as accessible in Chinese texts. As it stands this categorisation remains quite unsystematic and haphazard since most countable nouns are classified simply as n. One might consider calling nc only nouns where these are actually counted. One might also simply abandon the category and incorporate its examples into the straightforward category n. The problem with that is that after it is done one will not be able to retrieve these interesting cases …

noun preceding and modifying a sentence or sequence of sentences

*** 
"SS" is an ad hoc notation fora sequence of sentences. One might, evidently, always ask whether an S in our notation allows for or does not allow for the kind of complexity denoted by our formula SS.

There are adsentential nouns which have as their scope a whole paragraph rather than a single sentence. These are preliminarily collected in the present category. One could many more if one decides to cultivate this subcategory.

I have long hesitated whether in 平王 the head is 王 which is qualified by way of assigning a name to it, by 平 . A standard way of reading this, however, is to take it as a case of apposition. However one decides to take these words, they do seem to belong to one category which will need a coherent and homogeneous treatment.

As one is commenting on this one is tempted to simply delete this category. But on second thought it appears that this curious category does allow one to retrieve certain types of 己 .

** DEFINITION

intransitive verb following after nominal expression which modifies it.

*** 
This is a most puzzling idiomatic category which needs further study. The phenomenon is not uncommon, but structurally it still remains puzzling. Describing the surface structure as our formula does is only the first step towards a proper interpretation of this idiomatic syntactic structure.

Note that the 之 can apparently be omitted but that we still have no good examples of this.

** DEFINITION

denominal adjective: noun preceding and modifying a nominal expression

*** 
The distinction between vadN and nadN is often unclear. But note that 聖 as nadN means "characteristic of or belonging to a sage" whereas as vadN 聖 is more properly simply glossed as "sagely, wise". The distinction is fairly clear. 

The category nadN tries to register the cases where the adnominal use of a noun seems lexicalised and pregnant, as in the case of jia3 che1 甲車 "armoured vehicle" (which cannot be expanded to 甲之車 , and it tries to disregard the subtly but deeply indifferent unlexicalised cases of modification by a noun as in 王後 "behind the king", which is short for 王之後 and which is not the same as a royal (nadN) backside would be. 王冠 would then be ambiguous between one reading like 王之冠 "His Majesty's hat; the King's hat" on the one hand, in which the relationship between a certain king and a hat is one of yo3u 有 "ownership" grammaticalised as zhi1 之 , and "royal hat, royal heddress", where the relationship is not the extrinsic one of ownership but concerns the very nature of the hat concerned, and not just a lexically purely contingent matter of a X happening to belong to Y.

This category clearly presents many serious open problems. Does it make sense, in classical Chinese to ask whether wa2ng da4o 王道 is "the royal Way", or is it "the Way of the Kings"? A referential noun modifying another noun would seem to qualify as a real nadN: 故臣罪莫重於弒君 "Therefore there is no greater crime for a minister than to assassinate his ruler" does not involve any notion of a "ministerial crime", and che2n 臣 does not characterise the zui4 罪 . Consequently, such a usage would not qualify for the introduction of a LEXICAL ENTRY for 臣 as an nadN.

None the less, it remains striking that while guo2 國 "state" forms such current compounds as guo2 ju1n 國君 "ruler over a state", the NP guo2 jia1 國家 does not seem to form such compounds, and *** 國家君主 "??ruler of a nation??"***, though semantically seemingly impeccable is not current classical Chinese. Thus it is important to know which nouns can serve as modifiers and which cannot, just as it is important to record which can be modified and which cannot.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb with a lexically determined or predictable omitted object

*** 
The typically lexically determinate but omitted object is a general object like "things; the situation". But there are not so few cases where what is omitted is more specific, like "a document" or "a person" etc..

Moreover, what is lexically determinate may be only one of the participants in the situation that the verb refers to. One might have gone into much more detail about such problems of implicit valency, but this would lead too far into complex analytic problems that are more philosophical than linguistic in nature.

For example in the English "he drinks" we have a verb of which the object is understood lexically to be "alcohol". In "he is eating" the object that is lexically understood is "some kind of food". We must try to identify the Chinese verbs that work like this and try to distinguish them carefully from intransitive verbs. In classical Chinese we have words that work like English "eat", but not like the idiomatic English "drink".

** DEFINITION

subjectless verb with its object, this phrase modifying a verb phrase with an explicit or implicit subject that follows (e.g. zhi4 至 "until" as in 至暮不來 "did not come until the evening" 至秋不成。 "by the autumn they do not ripen".)

*** 
The question whether the V has to be taken as a "minor sentence" often raises a moot point. And as often mentioned elsewhere the minor as well as the major verbal sentence should be taken as a subtype of a V.

The question who arrived at the evening cannot be answered with a plausible classical Chinese word. Clearly, zhi4 至 "until" is derived from the verb "to arrive at". But the point is that this verb is here used in a puzzling subjectless way.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb (with passive meaning) modified by place noun that precedes it, this whole phrase in turn modifying a noun that follows.

*** 
(It is pleasing to see how the formula, here as often, comes to be much more transparent and easy than its English paraphrase.)

It appears that the predicative use of a construction like 屈產 is uncommon or unidiomatic, to say the least, and therefore I take this word to be subcategorised not only for the post-nominal but also for the adnominal position.

*** 
An exocentric construction. The postulation of the omitted "(.adN2)" is uncomfortable because it is primarily based on semantic analysis. In the end what is needed is a coherent analysis of the varying kinds of omission or deletion in classical Chinese. In order to do this well, we need a wide range of relevant cases. It is these that we are collecting under headings like these. They are retrievable in the system by looking for "(" in the syntactic category field.

This category allows one in special cases to assemble the uses as an object of certain nouns. In the cases like that of 民 this is of considerable historical interest. But in the case of most nouns there is no need to list and study their uses as objects versus subjects. Syntactic categories like these illustrate very well the way in which our analytical categories quite often do reflect our more general cognitive interest in addition to our grammatical interest. Our categories are analytic tools which we create for our varied intellectual uses.

** DEFINITION

a complex noun preceding and modifying a nominal expression

*** 
Adnominal noun phrases are common, but the recurrent question is to what extent their adnominal fucntion should be regarded as "lexicalised". In "the emperor's new concubine" "emperor" is not in our lexicalised sense adnominal, but if one were to call a concubine "imperial concubine", in Chinese, then the word for "imperial" (probably the same as that for "emperor" would count as adnominal, and in particular as a denominal adjective "nadN".

Note that whenever an binome can function both as VP and as NP, the distinction between NPadN and VPadN becomes not only problematic but in many cases quite uninteresting.

** DEFINITION



*** 
The borderline between containers and volume classifiers can be problematic at times. Also, for classical Chinese there is a rather interesting tendency for classifiers to be used in (long or short) lists. In general, the structural analysis of "classifier phrases" in Old Chinese remains highly controversial, of course.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb with omitted contextually determinate object preceding and modifying a main verb

*** 
One might always explain this as a simple coordination of two verbs, and "etymologically" that is no doubt what we have. The question is whether there is not here a structural frame rather like the case of a slightly different frame for 往 "go along (to do something)", where there are so many relevant examples that one feels certain that a syntactic category vt(+N.)-V is warranted.

** DEFINITION

a deverbal word which precedes and modifies a sentence, a preposed sentence-adverb in traditional parlance.

*** 
These are notoriously difficult to distinguish from vadV, in particular when the subject is omitted. In these latter cases I think one should treat them as the more common vadV.

A further complication arises from the fact that many apparent vadS are in fact anteposed adverbs rather than real logical sentential adverbs.

NB: Sentential adverbs linking sentences, i.e. sentence connectives become vadS1.adS2 and the like.

** DEFINITION

abstract complex nominal (construction type: conjunction of synonymous nominals) preceding and modifying a head noun

*** 
If we decide to fully implement this, a large number of NPadN will have to be moved into this category. However, the application of criteria of abstractness are going to pose severe problems if this is to be done.

The standard criteria we may have for the application of syntactic categories are often only marginally applicable when these syntactic categories are embedded into larger structures. Thus even in the case of 聖人 it is not at all evident whether 聖 should be labeled "v" or "n", i.e. whether the construction type is "vadN" or "nadN", or indeed "n/vadN", or "n/vadN".

** DEFINITION

count noun. Noun that can be counted without necessarily being found counted in our sources. These should be renamed nc.

*** 
1. N is negatable, if at all, only by fēi 非 "is not" and not by the verbal negation bù 不 "not".

2. N, if a count noun Nc (for count nouns see below), may be counted without classifiers.

3. N, if a count noun Nc, may be counted with postposed classifiers (mass nouns Nm may be countable with preposed classifiers/measure words)

4. N can be conjoined with words of the same category by the yǔ 與 "and" or jí 及 "and" and not by ér 而 "and", which links verbal expressions or (verbal) sentences (which - incidentally - should strictly speaking be classified syntactically as Vs).

5. N can function as subject, object, or topic without change of meaning.



By calling count nouns simply "n" our notation recognises that this is the default category of nouns with the largest number of members.

Countability is a complex matter to judge in all those cases where things seem countable but are not in fact counted. Instances where n are actually counted might be entered as "nc" to make them retrievable. Such a classification would be purely heuristic, enabling one to trace counting practice, and would not involve a categorial judgment on the word as such.

** DEFINITION

denominal sentential adverb: a noun which precedes and modifies a sentence

*** 
The distinction between nadS and nadV is not always clear, since there are so many subjectless sentences in classical Chinese. Thus it can become arbitrary whether the verb that follows a noun is a subjectless sentence or just a verb. 

N.B. At this point, as at many other points one develops a serious doubt whether S should be treated as a syntactic category at all, or whether for a language like Chinese it might not be more congenial to regard sentencehood as a pragmatic function mainlyof verb phrases, where objects and subjects etc. can be understood or specified. I have often considered this problem, but I have never ventured into any systematic attempt at implementation of this insight.

S refers to a constrution headed by or identical with a predicative phrase, i.e. headed by what in a general way one might write as V{PRED} or N{PRED}.

** DEFINITION

subjectless transitive verb followed by its sentential object

*** 
It is a puzzling fact that a word like yue1 曰 "say" can be used impersonally "it is said" in a way that would tempt us very much to describe it as a subjectless verb with a sentential object. It is very clear that the formula gu4 yue1 故曰：。。。 "therefore it is said:'...'." very often does not invite or even allow a question who the author/speaker/source is for what is quoted. Nonetheless, the phrase often invites one to look in the context for an omitted generic or concrete subject. Since this subject is idiomatically omitted, we have moved the 曰 to the category vt(0). Quod vide.

** DEFINITION

subjectless transitive verb without a contextually determinate subject, (e.g. yu3 雨 in 冬十月，雨雪 "In the winter (of 704 BC) it rained snow> snowed." It is implausible to think that this was sludge. The striking phenomenon to record was snow, and there is no grammatical or logical subject envisaged.)

*** 
This is has aroused much discussion, and certainly this category needs to be carefully distinguished from that of intransitive simply feature-placing verbs like vi0.

If there is a subject in such cases, it is never xue3 雪 "snow", but occasionally (as in LS 21.1.2) tia1n 天 "the sky; Heaven". Similarly we have 建武三十一年中，陳留雨穀 "A.D. 55 it rained grain in Che2n Liu2", and the current subject for this phrase is again tia1n 天 "the sky; Heaven". Thus the current 天雨穀 should probably be interpreted causatively with an embedded subjectless verb: "Heaven caused it to rain grain". The causative can be made explicit, as in: 使雨雪甚 "they caused it to snow hard." (LS 21.1.2.5)

** DEFINITION

abstract complex nominal expression modified by a preceding nominal expression. (See also NPpost-N)

*** 
In general, NPs are not yet subcategorised when they enter more complex constructions, because the criteria of abstractness of nominal expressions are so hard to apply in these syntactic contexts. One would be reduced to purely semantic intuitions in applying such a subcategorisation across the board.

** DEFINITION

deverbal adjective, verb which precedes and modifies a head noun, traditionally: a deverbal adjective

*** 
vadN and nadN are notoriously hard to distinguish in certain coherent sets of cases where derivation from verbal and nominal uses is equally plausible. One might come to designate these cases as v/n.adN, just as one may want to settle for a category v/n.adV for corresponding adverbials. This has not so far been implemented.

The standard criteria we may have for the application of syntactic categories are often only marginally applicable when these syntactic categories are embedded into larger structures. Thus even in the case of 聖人 it is not at all evident whether 聖 should be labeled "v" or "n", i.e. whether the construction type is "vadN" or "nadN", or indeed "n/vadN", or "n/vadN". 

There are cases, like that of 霸 , where a given word invites both the categories vadN "leading as in 霸王 " and nadN "characteristic of a hegemon as in 霸道 ".

** DEFINITION

transitive verb followed by a nominalised sentential object

*** 
We take the sentence "S" to be defined as a predicative (verbal or nominal) expression with an explicit or implicit subject. Nominalisation of this kind of sentence is categorised as NPab[S], i.e. an abstract noun phrase which is a nominalisation of a sentence. Nominal sentences are - we note in passing - not easily nominalised in classical Chinese, so that "Socrates's being a man" is not a logical construction that goes naturally into classical Chinese, and certainly not without the addition of a (nominalised) copula like 為 . 待考 

Nominalisation of sentences is standardly by qi2 其 replacing the subject or by the addition of 之 between subject and predicate. Unmarked nominalisation is often hard to be sure of and to diagnose with conviction. 

Evidently, this vt+NPab[S] may be viewed as a sub-class of ordinary vt+N, where N happens to be the nominalisation of a sentence labelled as NPab[S].

*** 
The relation between the vt and the verbal expression it precedes remains controversial. The function of 曰 in such contexts reminds one of the function of quotation marks rather than of a full negatable speech verb. In any case, 曰 will have to be treated as a "defective verb" in any grammar of Classical Chinese because it is not normally negatable, and - though transitive - is never followed by the object particle 之 .

** DEFINITION

transitive or relational noun.

A noun is deemed nt insofar as its semantics essentially involves a relation to something else. For example, the concept of MOTHER essentially involves being MOTHER OF someone else, just as the semantics of DISCIPLE involves being DISCIPLE of someone else.



transitive concrete noun

*** 
This very important class, like its even more important sister class, the nab.t has not yet been fully implemented. It will assemble all those nouns for the semantics of which it is constitutive that they involve relations: thus one is a wife exactly to the extent that one has a certain relation to a husband, and one is a father exactly to the extent that one has a certain relation to a child. Needless to say, the valency of nouns presents many unresolved problems, but a first step towards their solution will be to assemble the candidates in a syntactic group.

The notion that not only abstract nouns but also concrete nouns can be transitive is current from many studies in the valency of words. MEL'CUK 1984-1999 presents many relevant cases in what he calles the "regime" of a noun. The notion of a ruler is transitive because a ruler is only a ruler to the extent that he is a ruler of a realm. A protector is only a protector to the extent that there is something which he protects. A murderer is only a murderer to the extent that there is someone he has killed. All agent nominalisations of transitive verbs retain the transitivity of the verb from which they derive in this abstract sense. Even the notion of a "wife" differs from that of a woman that the former is relational and technically speaking transitive whereas the latter is not. Thus the class of transitive nouns that are modified by other nouns that precede them in this specific "transitive" way is considerable. A large number of what are now still simply nouns in TLS will have to be reclassified as ntpost-N.

Like all syntactic analyses of functions of 所 , this one feels most awkward and one hopes for better ideas to get to grips with it. 

This surely is not a real function class describing a lexicalised specialisation of suo3 所 . On the other hand, it is an aim of SSC to record the complex frames into which particles can enter idiomatically. Thus I am not, at this stage, quite sure that one could delete this kind of structural record without some significant loss of information.

In the long run one may well wish to specify what kinds of verbal expression in fact occur in front of the question pronouns. We should then have to further subdivide the category. Such subdivision will always remain possible, but in cases like this it seems ominously desirable.

There is also a very serious question of why exactly we call these kinds of words pronouns! 待考

** DEFINITION

a particle preceding and "adverbially" modifying a verb

*** 
Here, as often, it is hard to establish how direct and evident the derivation of a grammaticalised particle has to be for it to remain deverbal. The problem is systematic: grammaticalisation is a matter of degrees, and our categorisation is discreet.

an abstract transitive noun in construction with a preceding nominal expression

*** 
One could evidently treat these cases as plain npost-N. But this category is a reminder that the transitivity of deverbal abstract nouns needs a more systematic exploration than it has received so far in TLS.

Abstract transitive action nouns with specified subject are common and need to be collected systematically.

** DEFINITION

abstract noun (of which there is a wide semantic variety with a variety of syntactic properties)

*** 
Criteria one can try to use to determine whether a given noun is abstract:

1. cannot be counted with classifiers and are counted - if at all - not by physical items (see nab.c "counted abstract nouns")

2. cannot be quantified by universal, existential or graded quantifiers 

3. cannot be specified with respect to amounts of any concrete stuff

4. the object designated by the n cannot be said to move in space

Criteria for some basic related subclassifications of nouns

Nouns that can be counted and quantified by items or concrete things are called count nouns nc.

Nouns that cannot be counted or quantified by concrete items but can be quantified by amounts or kinds rather than items are regarded as mass nouns and these are called nm. When nm are preceded by a demonstrative pronoun, the interpretation is "this kind of nm".



The identification and the semantic subclassification of abstract nouns poses insurmountable problems because abstraction clearly is a matter of degrees on the one hand, and abstraction is a heterogeneous phenomenon. The vague and necessarily overlapping semantic subcategories introduced so far are no more than a first aid towards a resolution of these severe and unresolved analytical problems. Perhaps one should have opted for no subcategorisation at all, but we have decided to make a preliminary attempt to sort the material into major groups, even at the risk of having to make many arbitrary decisions in this process of preliminary sorting.

** DEFINITION

ditransitive verb with contextually determinate omitted pivotal object, preceding and in construction with a verbal expression

*** 
One must be suspicious of the label "vtt" here. The case is, after all, very different from such vtt as "give" in English. Perhaps one should assign sentential objects to pivotal constructions, but that is refuted by the substitutability of the subject in the object sentence by 之 . 待考

** DEFINITION

complex transitive verbal with a verbal object the omitted subject of which is lexically determinate, i.e. predictable from the VPt.

*** 
The expressions subsumed under this category involve many widely different construction types. It will be interesting to see the range of construction types that allow transitivity with a verbal object. The construction types need to be elaborated systematically for all NPs as well as VPs according to a consistent and systematic pattern.

For the resultative VPt+V the question arises whether the verbal object only goes with the second verb indicating the result, or whether the construction is as suggested by the present analysis. Without evidence from prosody this will be difficult to decide.

** DEFINITION

pronoun followed by and in apposition with a nominal expression

*** 
Note that npro++Npr, where the apposition is with a proper name is a special case. 

Apposition, marked as "++" is as between "I" and "George W. Bush" in the phrase "I, George W. Bush".

** DEFINITION

a noun that is a a pro-form, traditionally: a pronoun

*** 
1. may sometimes idiomatically precede negated transitive verb as the object of that verb.

2. cannot normally be modified (as in English "poor old me").

3. can hardly function as a topic in its pronominal meaning.

4. often functions as a substitute for a contextually determinate noun (this, of course, does not hold for question pronouns etc).

5. has no derivative functions as a denominal adverb, thus there is no npro.adV, although occasional abstract nominalisations are attested.

6. npro differs interestingly from nouns with pronominal semantics "n - pro" such as 臣 which are analysed as having the semantic feature "pro".

It appears useful to consider to what extent these special nouns do come to function as objects. This category will provide a place to make such cases retrievable. For example it makes good sense to ask whether 宋人 currently serves as an object or not. 

Thus this category illustrates the way in which some our grammatical categories will result from subjective research interest, cognitive interest rather than purely "objective" analytic need.

** DEFINITION

complex proper name, including names of persons, places and even periods of time



CRITERIA

1. cannot be counted, except in what traditional rhetoric calls the Vossian style. ( 十堯 does not mean "ten copies of Ya2o", but "ten people of the general kind defined by Ya2o as a typical example".)

2. cannot be quantified with words for "all", "some", or "many"

3. take non-restrictive adjectival modification

*** 
There are borderline cases where one is not certain whether an NP deserves to be called NPpr. In "even ten Yaos cannot govern such a state", Yao is not really a proper name, or is it? Perhaps we should simply treat the words like "Yao" in this sentence as a plain count noun. That is the logically attractive solution - which flies in the face of etymology and "Sprachgefuehl".

** DEFINITION

a verb preceding and modifying a verbal expression, this whole phrase preceding and modifying a sentence

*** 
This category illustrates well the general problem created by the traditionalist acceptance of the notion of a sentence as a syntactic category. (See GRAMMATICAL SURVEY) Our grammatical description would be greatly simplified if the sentence could be recognised as a verb phrase in which the subject happens to be specified along with other arguments like objects. There is, of course, a distinct advantage in distinguishing the position of a word before the main verb and before the subject of a sentence. The position after the subject could be categorised as "XadV.postN" to capture this special feature. Until now I have preferred to be traditionalist on this matter, at the cost of much meaningless categorial duplication. One's patience is wearing thin.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: uuid-c20780b3-41f9-491b-bb61-a269c1c4b48f
:END:        


** DEFINITION

intransitive verb, verb which has no explicit or implicit object. 



vi is often hard to distinguish from a transitive verb with a contextually determinate omitted object vi(oN), and even more difficult to distinguish from a transitive verb with a lexically determinate omitted object as in the English "he drinks", for which see vt[oN].

*** 
Criteria for the intransitivity of a verb X:

1. X is verbal and may not be preceded by the object pronoun suǒ 所 or followed by the object pronoun zhī 之 or an explicit nominal or verbal object without changing its meaning.

Note that yuē 曰 "say" would turn out intransitive if the acceptability of zhī 之 and suǒ 所 were taken as the sole criterion. Not all words that disallow pronominalisation of the object are for that reason intransitive.

2. X is verbal and cannot have a contextually determinate or contextually retrievable "understood" referential object.

3. "Diffuse" objects of verbs create a problem when they cannot be made explicit.



In practice, the decision whether a verb is or is not intransitive is often frustratingly complex and irresolvably problematic. When there is no object, as in English "he is jealous", the semantics of jealousy still involves an object. In this case we ascribe a semantic feature "trans", as in vi - tr. For example, there is no doubt that the English "complain" describes a speech act which involves complaining about something: there is no complaining that is not about something. Semantically and logically, at some deep level, there is always an object of complaint. Indeed, there typically is also an audience to which the complaint is addressed.



However, in a sentence like "She loves complaining" one would like to take complaining to be intransitive because both objects are not specified and no specific objects are understood. One could rest satisfied with this, if there weren't examples like "She loves complaining about things." Here no object is specified, and yet there is an overt grammatical object, so that we have a clear case of vtt. Even worse is "She loves complaining to people about things". Here we have two overt grammatical objects (in our terminology a clear case of a ditransitive verb vtt, although none of the referential objects are specified.



In TLS we handle the problem as follows: a verb which occurs without any object, and without any specific object being understood is taken to be an instance of an intransitive verb.



When such a verb is followed, for example, by the very common indeterminate zhī 之 "something, things" we acknowledge this as a transitive use of the verb, with the semantic specifier - obj=unspecified, or - trans. 



This still leaves some surprising problems: for one thing shā rén 殺人 "commit murder; kill others" is not usually used to distinguish between the killing of humans as opposed to killing animals, nor is it currently used to distinguish murder from suicide. Thus even this kind of rén 人 would have to count as an object triggering "obj=unspecified". The number of verbs that work like shā 殺 in this respect and take rén 人 as an unspecified object does not seem to be large and these verbs need to be identified and listed. A second problematic case is that of the spurious general indeterminate object pronoun zhī 之 which is often translatable and does not seem to convert the preceding vi into a semantic vt. These cases are worth collecting, and I propose to call them - obj=diffuse.

The intrusion of the semantic feature [OBJ] into this formula is messy, and designed to distinguish this from the case of subject pronouns in front of Vt. Note that there are no subject pronouns specialised on a position in front of transitive rather than intransitive verbs. The function of this [OBJ] is primarily mnemonic and may have to be removed for reasons of systematicity, so that this category will simply become "npro+Vt - ref=obj". This will certainly be neater.

transitive verb followed by a nominal expression, this nominal not being a straightforward object pronominalisable by 之 (as in the the more ordinary vtoN).

*** 
The criteria of objecthood are often unclear, but it seems clearly desirable to distinguish between verbs that require a direct object on the one hand and verbs that typically have nominal complements of other types. Some of what are now classified as vtoN will have to be reclassified as vt+N upon closer analysis. But this still needs to be examined.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb with a (not overtly nominalised) sentential object

*** 
It is often not easy to determine whether these sentences functioning as objects should or should not be regarded as cases of unmarked nominalisation. 

Moreover, there are persistent problems in distinguishing the cases where the transitive verb is followed by a V with a contextually determinate subject, which should be vt+S from straight vt+V. The reasons for this are of a profound logical nature.

** DEFINITION

abstract complex noun; construction type: N1 is conjoined with N2 which is taken as synonymous in the context

[THE BRACKET NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIELD "CONSTRUCTION TYPE"]

*** 
It is often excruciatingly difficult to decide whether N1 or N2 do or do not contribute significantly different nuances in a given compound. Nor would it be correct to assume that there would always be unanimity among native speakers of classical Chinese on this matter. On the other hand, it seems important to distinguish between compounds in which a broader meaning is indicated by two contrasting nouns on the one hand, and the cases where a new more explicitly general noun is formed by two nouns that are taken to be synonymous. For example, in 死亡 "death" the reference is NOT to any kind of ceasing to exist, so that whereas there is a difference between the consituent words here, this difference is not operative in the word formation here (according to our present analysis which is - of course - very much open to discussion).

Finally, one should remember that all these bracketed syntactic specifications can and must now be moved into the newly established field of "construction type".

** DEFINITION

transitive commpound verbal expression

*** 
It is not at all clear when these VPt are construed as two verbs as in "I despise and detest racists", i.e. as a zeugma series vt(+N).+vt+N, and when they really constitute one complex transitive complex verb VPt+N. The question is to what extent this distinction is actually operative in and practically relevant to classical Chinese grammar. In order to investigate this question we do need a rich collection of cases to consider. This category supplies such a list.

TO BE DELETED



complex noun phrase which consists of a noun modifying and followed by a place noun

[THE BRACKET NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIELD "CONSTRUCTION TYPE"]

*** 
In NPs like this one often needs to ask whether the phrase is or is not lexicalised, on the other hand the question whether these NPs constitute idiomatic noun phrases or complex nouns seems irrelevant to the grammatical structure of classical Chinese. It is an uncongenial question imposed from outside the system of the language.

** DEFINITION

complex particle followed by and in construction with a verbal predicate, this whole predicate characteristically having a contextually determinate omitted subject.

*** 
The point of this category is to register the characteristic idiomatically almost obligatory absence of the subject. This kind of case must be carefully distinguished from the case where the V in question is subjectless, i.e. v0 in our current system. In fact, v0 cannot occur in the position V in this formula.

** DEFINITION

noun which precedes and modifies a main verb, traditionally: denominal adverb

*** 
The denominal nature of these nadV is problematic in all those cases where both nominal and verbal uses of the character in question are well attested and equally common. For many cases one is tempted to introduce a category n/vadN.

The distinction between nadV and nadS is by no means always clear, even in context, wherever S is a verbal sentence and thus syntactically speaking and strictly speaking a VP.

** DEFINITION

a transitive verb with its nominal object, this phrase preceding and modifying a main verb; otherwise often called a coverb

*** 
Subcategorisation for adverbial function can be problematic whenever one has to decide whether a verb in that syntactic context is lexically specialised on this or not. Decisions on lexicalisation of this sort are by their very nature often subjective.

negative verb with a pivotal ditransitive verbal construction in the object, i.e. transitive negative verb preceding and in construction with it transitive-verb-object with contextually determinate omitted object, this latter phrase being followed by a verb

*** 
It is not so easy to regard this as a plain case of vt[NEG]+Vt(+N): there is the problem of the scope which one is tempted to take to extend across the whole of the verb phrase. This matter of scope remains open to discussion, but for such a discussion to be fruitful the relevant examples have to be assembled first. Making this assembly possible is the purpose of the present syntactic category.

** DEFINITION

particle modifying a preceding N

*** 
One should not jump to the conclusion that these are suffixes. Topic markers like 者 are surely not suffixes, but they may seem to fall into this category. Etymologically, 者 is the head of the noun phrase after which it occurs. Should we maintain this in the cases where 者 functions as a topic marker? This needs discussion. Does a post-nominal particle which marks the noun as s topic thereby "modify" that noun. I think so!

** DEFINITION

a particle which precedes and modifies a verbal expression, this whole phrase following after and being in construction with a preceding sentence

*** 
The recurrent problem is how to determine exactly when and why a V may count as a minor sentence. If one had the courage to declare a verbal sentence to be really a VS, i.e. a kind of V then many problems would be solved both in this category and in many others. So far, I have not had the courage to implement this analysis, although I have been thinking about it for years.

** DEFINITION

particle preceding and modifying a nominalised sentence, that whole construction preceding and modifying another sentence

*** 
凡 frequently comes in front of un-nominalised sentences. The existence of explicitly nominalised cases might open up the possibility of regarded the presentential use of 凡 as simply a case of unmarked nominalisation. This would be plausible if the marked cases were predominant. But they are not.

The words in this category are paraphrasable as "N1 id est N2", where the semantic difference between N1 and N2 is neutralised in the context. It is by no means a trivial question when this neutralisation has taken place and when it has not.

A great deal of research remains to be done on exactly what distinguishes these NPs from their monosyllabic constitutents when the latter are used in the broader sense that Duan Yucai called 涽言 "the diffuse meaning".

** DEFINITION

intransitive binome where the constituent syllables are not taken to have an independent meaning in TLS.

An indispensable handbook on these important words in YE MENG 1993. On the problems these words raise KENNEDY "Butterfly" remains crucial.

*** 
These words often have rhyme, alliteration or at least assonance and form an important part of the Chinese vocabulary of lively or intensitive description. Also, these words are notorious for the variety of graphs they allow for each binome, sometimes dozens. It remains to be investigated whether apart from vvadN there also are many cases of vvt+N or even vvtt+N1.+N2 and so on. This requires systematically focussed detailed research that has not so far been done.

** DEFINITION

A verbal expression that functions as a complete sentence.



{nominal or verbal constituent that can function pragmatically as a self-contained utterance or sentence}

Strictly speaking, from a syntactic point of view, verbal sentences are verb phrases and nominal sentences are noun phrases, because they have verbal and nominal heads respectively.

*** 
It may seem extraordinary that sentences can be lexicalised, but that, I think, is what sometimes happens. In any case, under this category we collect cases of whole sentences that it seems desirable to enter as lexical entry. One might say that 如之何 is a verb phrase functioning as a sentence.

We retain this category as a polite concession to many traditional linguists who standardly (but mistakenly) have long treated the pragmatic notion of a sentence as a syntactic notion.

** DEFINITION

a complex nominal preceding and modifying a sentence

*** 
The notion of "modification" is here taken to include that of "being the time or place topic of". In "Yesterday, it was raining" we take "yesterday" to modify "it was raining" by indicating when it was raining. The words in this group are supposed to be lexically specialised on their adsentential funtion. Thus in "This idiot, he was overtaking me on the left" the expression "this idiot" is not taken to be lexicalised on the topicalised/exposed function and would therefore not qualify for our category.

a transitive verb with a regularly omitted but invariant and syntactically predictable omitted subject and an omitted but contextually determinate object (e.g. nuo4 諾 "yes!")

The deverbal nature of we2i 唯 "Yes!" is clear enough, as it is in the comparable case of nuo4 諾 "Yes!". Moreover the logical subject is not in question: in both cases the underlying deep logical subject is the speaker who agrees. But the point is that in its grammaticalised form this word could have no more of a subject than the English "Yes!" Therefore we register this kind of grammaticalised verb as subjectless with a bracketed "(0)".

** DEFINITION

a complex nominal expression preceding and modifying a sequence of sentences (compare also NPadS)

*** 
This is an experimental category which tries to capture the distinction between sentence modifiers the scope of which is one and only one sentence, and those sentence-modifiers the scope of which ranges over a whole sequence of sentences.

The reduplicated ad hoc mnemonic symbol "SS" is to indicate that the scope of this NP is not just one sentence but a whole paragraph. The unattractive messiness of this notation is helpful because it reminds us that in principle the analytic system in TLS does not provide means to specify units larger than a sentence. Thus in principle whatever has a paragraph as its grammatical scope comes to look as if it had a sentence as its scope. The deviant notation "SS" would solve this problem.

complex intransitive verbal, complex verbal unit

*** 
(For the often problematic but still important distinction with the category vvi "intransitive verbal binome the constituents of which have no independent meaning" see Kennedy, "Butterfly". As for reduplicated verbs, they have been classified, preliminarily, as vi.red.)

Complex intransitive verbs may or may not be semantically transitive, and when they are, they are labelled as VPi - tr.

In principle, a verbal expression counts as complex only if its constituent syllables have independent meaning. This is often difficult to ascertain. A word may always cooccur with a certain other word and still have its independent meaning. In doubtful cases we assume independent meaning. A bisyllabic intranstive verbal where the constituent syllables are taken not to have independent meaning is categorised as vvi.

additive complex nominal expression N1+N2 with the meaning "N1 and N2, N1 in addition to N2"

[THE BRACKET NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIELD "CONSTRUCTION TYPE"]

*** 
It is by no means trivial to decide when a meaning is additive, as the case of 國家 shows: etymologically, there is no doubt that we have a conjunction of "state" plus "major clans", but the idiomatic meaning of the phrase does NOT seem to retain this additive etymological nuance.

Needless to say, the structural description in brackets [N1&N2] logically belongs into the field of "construction types", and the problem is that construction types can be etymological only, and they can be of current direct semantic relevance.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb with a lexically predictable omitted logical subject, with pronominal object which modifies another transitive verb with its object (e.g. 譬之若 x)

*** 
This syntactic category is puzzling because for the predictable and invariant logical subject there is no overt explicit form in Chinese. How can one claim that a subject is omitted when in fact one does not know how it could be made explicit in the first place? One might in the end need the very interesting notion not of an omitted subject, but of a generic zero-subject. This is a matter that must be pursued.

** DEFINITION

a noun preceding and in construction with a proper name nominal expression

*** 
In "Thief Zhi" one feels that the correct grammatical paraphrase is "Zhi, who happens to be of the thief-kind", so that one might read this as "nadNpr". The problem is that many of the words in this category might well have to be taken as being in apposition to the proper name that follows. The formula n+Npr seems therefore appropriately non-committal on how exactly the construction is to be taken.

** DEFINITION

adnominal pronoun, a pronoun which modifies and precedes a nominal expression

*** 
Under this category it is registered which npro are found to function, under what circumstances, in adnominal function. Note that the number of npro.adN is significantly smaller than the number of plain npro: this illustrates that not all pronouns can function adnominally. And, manifestly, many of the diagnostic criteria applicable to npro cannot be brought to bear on npro.adN. However npro.adN do tend to function as a substitute for a contextually determinate noun.

** DEFINITION

transitive verb with an omitted contextually determinate passive-verbal object

*** 
It is not yet clear how many of the other vt+V[PASS] can have omitted objects. This needs to be investigated. It would be perfectly possible to classify these verbs simply as vt(+V), obviously, and the only reason we do not choose this simple solution is that we might wish to study exactly the cases of passivised rather than non-passivised contextually determinate omitted verbal objects.
