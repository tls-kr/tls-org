** DEFINITION

INSECT WHICH HAS FRONT WINGS AND BACK WINGS, AND HARD SKIN COVERING BACK WINGS AND ABDOMEN.

** NOTES

*** Old Chinese Contrasts
Note that there are 290 000 known kinds of bettles. See J. Dupr√©, "Natural kinds and biological taxa", Philosophical Review no. 90 (1981) pp. 66-90, in particular see p. 76. The important conclusion to draw is that TLS must always remain concerned with conceptual folklore rather than with scientific taxonomy.
