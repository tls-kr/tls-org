******* Examples
ZUO Xuan 8.4 (601 B.C.); Y:697; W:511; L:302; mod CH

 晉胥克有蠱疾， Seu K 掂 h of Tsin suffered an illness due to bewitchment.

 郤缺為政。 Keoh Keueh became chief minister of the State.

ZUO Zhao zhuan 1.12 

 曰： who said,

 「疾不可為也，涆 he disease cannot be cured,-

 是謂近女室， according to the saying that when women are approached,

 疾如蠱。 the chamber disease becomes like insanity.

 非鬼非食， It is not caused by Spirits nor by food;

 惑以喪志。 it is that delusion which has destroyed the mind.

 良臣將死， Your good minister will (also) die;

 天命不佑。」 it is not the will of Heaven to preserve him. �
