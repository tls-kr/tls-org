** DEFINITION

DOCTRINE that one SHOULD DESPISE ALL THINGS AND PERSONS BECAUSE THEY LACK REAL VALUE.

** NOTES

*** Old Chinese Criteria
To the student of ancient philosophy there is in Cynicism scarcely

more than a rudimentary and debased version of the ethics of

Socrates, which exaggerates his austerity to a fanatic asceticism,

hardens his irony to sardonic laughter at the follies of mankind,

and affords no parallel to his genuine love of knowledge.

Well might Plato have said of the first and greatest Cynic,

'That man is Socrates gone mad.' Dudley p. ix

Cynicism is

usually presented to us in histories of Greek philosophy, where

it forms an interlude of semi-comic relief between Socrates and

Plato, or between Plato and the Stoics.
