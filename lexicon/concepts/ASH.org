"This is an excellent introduction to the important role which relics played in the history of Chinese Buddhism. Kieschnick concludes: "In the case of relic pellets (sheli), sacred power was vague and impersonal, a living source of light that could appear from nowhere and at times reproduce itself. Devotees occasionally perceived other objects such as particular Buddhist scriptures, rosaries, or other belongings of holy figures as having this same power, but these objects were not accorded sacred power as consistently as relics were. This perception of the power of relics did not spring from a more general belief in a sacred man-like force present in all things; only a very limited number of objects were conceived in this way." (p.80)
