** DEFINITION

SCOLD or CRITICISE BY NOT FAIR ACCUSATIONS AND SATIRE.

** NOTES

*** Old Chinese Criteria
It will be interesting to look for evidence in China for the history of the form of the literary insult or pasquinade. Compare the German tradition Pasquill. See the singularly inspiring survey in the historical dictionary of rhetoric by Ueding which concentrates on Italian and German traditions of literary invective.
